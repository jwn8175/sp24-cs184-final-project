## Usage

### Default

Running `python3 main.py` will start the program with a default window size.

### Custom Window Size

Running `python3 main.py --size [WIDTH]x[HEIGHT]` will start the program with a custom window size of `(WIDTH, HEIGHT)`. Don't forget to include the `x` in between the two values.
